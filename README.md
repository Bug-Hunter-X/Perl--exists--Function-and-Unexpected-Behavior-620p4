This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Perl related to the `exists` function when accessing hash keys.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version. The issue arises because `exists` only checks for the key's presence, not whether the value is defined or undef. Accessing a non-existent key with the `exists` check will not throw an error, but will return undef.  The solution emphasizes the importance of proper null checking after the `exists` check to avoid unexpected undefined value errors.
